# Documentation for the IoT-Based Intrusion Detection System

## 1. Introduction

This document details the architecture, data flows, workflow processes, and network design of an IoT-based Intrusion Detection System. The documentation is supported by several diagrams that illustrate the system at various levels of abstraction:

- **Class Diagram:** Outlines the software object structure and relationships.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Presents both a high-level (Level 0) overview and a more detailed (Level 1) perspective of the data movement within the system.
- **IoT IDS Workflow Diagram:** Describes the end-to-end operation process from data collection to threat detection.
- **Network Topology Diagram:** Illustrates the physical and logical layout of network components in the system.

The following sections explain each diagram and discuss how they collectively define an efficient and secure IoT-based IDS.

## 2. System Architecture and Class Diagram

The **Class Diagram** provides a blueprint of the software architecture. It models the key objects, their properties, and how they interact within the system. This includes:

- **Entities and Components:** Definitions of classes such as Sensor, Gateway, DataProcessor, AlertManager, and User Interface.
- **Relationships:** Inheritance, aggregation, and associations between the classes that demonstrate interactions (e.g., a Gateway collects data from multiple Sensors and forwards it to DataProcessors).
- **Attributes and Methods:** Key attributes (e.g., sensorId, timestamp, dataValue) and methods (e.g., processData(), validateInput(), generateAlert()) that guide system functionality.

### Key Components Illustrated

- **Sensors:** Represent the endpoints that collect environmental or operational data.
- **Gateways:** Serve as intermediaries, transmitting data from sensors to central processing units.
- **Data Processors:** Analyze incoming data streams, executing algorithms to determine if anomalies (potential intrusions) are present.
- **Alert and Reporting Modules:** Generate notifications and reports based on the analytics, allowing for prompt response.

By defining these classes and their interconnections, the Class Diagram lays the foundation for both system functionality and future scalability.

## 3. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

### 3.1. Level 0 DFD – High-Level Overview

The Level 0 DFD presents a **context diagram** that establishes the boundaries of the system and depicts interactions with external entities. The diagram includes:

- **External Entities:** Such as administrators, third-party analytics services, or connected IoT devices outside the controlled network.
- **Major Processes:** A single, high-level process representing the entire IDS, which receives inputs (sensor data, user commands) and delivers outputs (alerts, reports).
- **Data Stores and Flows:** High-level depiction of how data enters the system, where it is stored briefly (e.g., temporary logs), and where it exits (external interfaces).

This abstract view is important for understanding the system’s role within a broader network and helps clarify boundaries between internal processes and external interactions.

### 3.2. Level 1 DFD – Detailed Process Breakdown

Building on the Level 0 DFD, the Level 1 diagram breaks the main process into sub-processes that detail specific functions:

- **Data Collection:** Capturing raw data from sensors and IoT devices.
- **Pre-Processing and Validation:** Ensuring that the data is clean, formatted, and relevant.
- **Analysis and Pattern Recognition:** Running algorithms to detect anomalies that may indicate a security threat.
- **Alert Management:** Triggering notifications and storing alert logs.
- **Feedback and Reporting:** Providing interfaces for administrators to review system behavior and performance statistics.

Each sub-process interacts with corresponding data stores (for example, historical data logs or current session caches), which together provide a coherent picture of the system's internal workings.

## 4. IoT-Based IDS Workflow Diagram

### Process Flow

![IoT based IDS workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2899c495-04c2-47b9-9769-681e253e8d60)

The **IoT-Based IDS Workflow Diagram** captures the sequential steps taken by the system to detect intrusions in real time:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Multiple sensors across the network measure various parameters. Data is captured continually from diverse sources.
2. **Data Transmission:** Through dedicated communication channels (often via wireless or wired connections), data is sent to local gateways.
3. **Initial Filtering:** The gateways perform preliminary filtering and aggregation, reducing the volume of redundant or irrelevant data.
4. **Centralized Analysis:** Consolidated data is forwarded to central servers where intensive analysis is conducted using rule-based or machine learning algorithms to identify potential threats.
5. **Alert Generation:** Upon detecting abnormal patterns or threshold breaches, the system generates alerts.
6. **Response and Logging:** Automated responses (e.g., isolating affected nodes) might be triggered, and detailed logs are maintained for further analysis and reporting.
7. **Administrator Notification:** Final alerts and summary reports are relayed to system administrators for review and action.

This workflow ensures that threats are detected and acted upon quickly, minimizing potential damage or data breaches.

## 5. Network Topology

### Architecture of Connections

The **Network Topology Diagram** provides a visual representation of the physical and logical arrangement of devices in the IoT-based IDS network. Key aspects include:

- **Device Layout:** Illustrates how various network nodes (sensors, gateways, servers, workstations) are interconnected. This can include wireless sensor networks, wired backbone connections, and secure communication channels.
- **Redundancy and Segmentation:** Highlights measures taken to ensure resilience, such as redundant paths to maintain communication during failures and network segmentation to isolate sensitive operations.
- **Security Zones:** Identifies where firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or additional security layers are deployed to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Communication Protocols:** Denotes the standards and protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP) used for secure and reliable data transmission between devices.

By mapping out the topology, the diagram clarifies the physical deployment and the security controls necessary for the overall system.

## 6. Integration and Inter-Relationships

### How the Diagrams Work Together

- **Unified Design Approach:**  
  The Class Diagram defines the core software elements that are implemented to drive the system functionality. These elements are deployed within the structure defined by the Network Topology, ensuring that physical and logical infrastructures support the software’s requirements.

- **Sequential Data Processing:**  
  The progression from the Level 0 to the Level 1 DFD illustrates a move from a macro view of data flows to a granular, step-by-step breakdown of processing. This linkage clarifies how data is transformed at each stage, from raw sensor inputs to actionable alerts.

- **Workflow to Reality:**  
  The IDS Workflow Diagram visually maps the lifecycle of data as it is acquired, processed, and responded to. This practical sequence is underpinned by both the software structure (as defined by the Class Diagram) and the communication framework (as shown by the Network Topology).

- **Security and Performance Considerations:**  
  Every diagram contributes to ensuring that the system is both secure and efficient. For example, while the Network Topology emphasizes secure and redundant connections, the DFDs highlight efficient data processing and robust error handling.
